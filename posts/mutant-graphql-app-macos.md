I'm happy to announce my first macOS Application:<br/>
**Mutant: a GraphQL Explorer App for macOS**

**UPDATE: I've abandoned this project and is currently unmaintained.**

It's a handy tool for GraphQL developers used to jump between
[Graph*i*QL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) and
[GraphQL-Voyager](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager).
Mutant combines the features of these two great tools in a lightweight macOS app.

~~There's still a lot of work to do, so I'm running a **beta test** to gather some feedback, and if you are a
GraphQL developer I can't wait to hear from you.~~

~~You can [download here](https://mutant.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/Mutant%201.0.0-beta.3.zip) the latest version of the app
and drop your thoughts to [stefano@brilli.me](mailto:stefano@brilli.me).~~

- _5 Jan 2018: Released 1.0.0-beta.3_</br>
  Removed reference to outdated swift dylib.
