# UpNotifications for Jawbone UP24

**UPDATE**: Google has changed a how the app should ask for the `READ_SMS, RECEIVE_SMS` permissions. Unfortunately I've not been able to update UpNotifications and this resulted in the app being removed from the Play Store.
I'm leaving here a link to the APK for anyone who's interested in trying out the app. Just keep in mind that I won't be able to provide any support.

### Intro

After my last blog post on [UP24 Reverse engineering](../up24_reverse_engineering) I received a lot emails about the Android application I wanted to write for myself to receive notifications on the jawbone up24 band.

During the last month I found the time to write such app and release a [demostration video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcVZpmnbII) of how it works.

### First release

Time has come to make this application publicly available, ~~and here you can have it for just a small fee that will allow me to keep the app up-to-date:
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.brilli.stefano.upnotifications" target="_blank">Download UpNotifications for UP24</a>.~~

### Requirements

- Official UP Application
- An UP24 band paired with your device
- Firmware version 3.0.21 running on your band

### Disclaimer

This application has been widely tested and it is proven to work correctly; actually the author itself use this app on a daily basis to get calls and sms notifications on its wrist.

However it is important to state that this application is the result of a reverse engineering process, hence:

- It may interfere with normal functioning of the band
- It may drain your band battery
- It may stop working anytime (especially after band's software update)
- It may not work with all band versions
