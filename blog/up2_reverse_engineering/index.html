And so I did.</p><p>I soon found out that the same trick of <em>sending a pairing command to make the band vibrate</em> was not working because the new UP2 knows if it has been already paired with a phone, and in that case it does not vibrate on pairing.</p><p>While the UP24 <strong>allowed anyone</strong> to make vibrate your band without your permission just by sending a pairing command, with the UP2 <strong>Jawbone has fixed this issue</strong>. Though this is a good news for all UP2 owners, this meant that I had to find another way to trigger the vibration.</p><blockquote><p>I needed to go deeper.</p></blockquote><p>I struggled to understand how the communication protocol has changed, and see if I could find another command to exploit. But just looking at the stream of bluetooth packets wasn’t enough…</p><p>so I though of disassembling the app and inspecting its <code>.smali</code> source code using <a href="http://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/">apktool</a> to search for anything that could be useful.</p><p>After going through the sources for a while I noticed a <code>log</code> method used all over the app, probably for debugging purposes, that was disabled just by a simple flag check.</p><p>In a file called <code>JBLog.smali</code>, I changed the following lines</p><pre><code>-   <span class="hljs-built_in"> if-nez </span>v0,<span class="hljs-keyword"> :cond_0</span>
+   <span class="hljs-built_in"> if-eqz </span>v0,<span class="hljs-keyword"> :cond_0</span>
</code></pre><p>then reassembled the app and installed into my phone.</p><blockquote><p>I started getting a lot of debug information placed there right from UP developers :)</p></blockquote><p>I immediately found out that the communication protocol was much more sophisticated than the one used for UP24.</p><p>Log messages like this</p><pre><code><span class="hljs-number">8257</span><span class="hljs-number">-8288</span>/com.jawbone.upopen I/UPOPEN﹕ StreamService &gt;&gt;&gt; writeOutputStream &gt; KeyExchangeRequest &gt;

</code></pre><p>were suggesting that the protocol was relying on some kind of encryption to communicate over a secure channel, using a shared encryption key exchanged at the time of pairing.</p><blockquote><p>I needed more, so I thought of using a decompiler.</p></blockquote><p>I tried some like <a href="https://bitbucket.org/mstrobel/procyon/">Procyon</a>, <a href="http://www.benf.org/other/cfr/">CFR</a> to get as much information as possible. With the help of a great tool called <a href="https://github.com/Konloch/bytecode-viewer">BytecodeViewer</a>, I stared to follow the code paths, drawing diagrams, understand the app flow and structures…</p><p>Eventually I reproduced all the steps needed to pair and setup an encrypted communication channel with the UP2 and send the vibration command I needed :)</p><iframe class="line-11-m line-17-d" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/uwsyjyM5GJU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><blockquote><p>Victory! … almost.</p></blockquote><p>As I came back on my initial goal of integrating UP2 support into UpNotifications, I realized that it would be very hard to achieve any kind of <em>user friendly</em> experience.</p><p>The first problem comes from the fact that the encryption key is kept secret into the original UP application, and the only way to retrieve such key is to have a <em>rooted</em> phone.</p><p>The second crucial problem is that, even if it was possible to get the encryption key easily, UP2 supports only one bluetooth connection at time. This means that an <em>UpNotifications for UP2</em> would not work while the band is connected to the original UP application.</p><p>And since there’s no way (without root permission) to control when the UP app runs or communicates with the band, <strong>UpNotifications for UP2 would be incompatible with the official UP app</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>I still haven’t decided whether write an <em>UpNotifications for UP2</em> or not…</p></blockquote><p>So, for the time being, I’m not releasing the source code of the “test” app I wrote (moreover, currently the code is quite a mess).</p><p>Also, I want to be sure of the legal consequences of releasing any protocol specs…</p><p>Unlike the old UP24, Jawbone is using this protocol on devices like UP4 for <a href="https://jawbone.com/blog/introducing-up4/">contactless payments</a>, so this time they could be much more interested in keeping the protocol as much secret as possible to avoid security issues.</p><p><em>– 19/09/2015</em></p></article><footer class="footer"><div>© Stefano Brilli.
